# Might and Magic Trilogy Merge: Iron Team's Journey
Author: Fanasilver; Translators: Tom CHEN (who has translated the first two sections) & Google Translate (the rest) ([中文](https://might-and-magic.github.io/mm678-guide/zh/walkthrough/))

I learned about the MMMerge mod last year (2018), but at that time it was incomplete and there were problems with main quests. This year (2019), I saw a few friends from our online community who had finished the game, which made me itching to do the same. I contributed a few bucks to GOG and got the mm8, then immediately installed the MMMerge patch and started my journey.

Self-imposed game rules:

1) "Iron Mode": no Save/Load (save the game then immediately load the game to beat some odds). If the team die, they'll "cheat death" and get back there ...

2) I should begin with MM6's continent, then MM7, then MM8. Only after the main quests of the previous continent is completed should I enter the next continent.

3) In order to fit the original settings of MM6, on the MM6's Enroth continent, all the skills are allowed to be trained only to the Master, with the only exception of the Water Magic Grandmaster (we need the Beacon)...

4) The difficulties (Monster Bolster percentages) of the three continents are 120%, 135%, 150%

5) After entering the final map "Breach", the difficulty should be restored to 100%

6) The "Wishing Well" in MM7 is not allowed, but the "Experience Well" in MM6 and the "Horseshoe Tree" in MM8 are allowed. Anyway, no Save/Load is allowed, and the enemy's ability increases rapidly, these make the game very difficult, therefore, the wells couldn't help too much, they can only be used to get a better score...

7) Each character can only wear two items that increase Magic Skills, and one artifact

There are some settings in MMMerge that greatly reduce the difficulty of the game, which should also be limited by my rule:

1) Our team will not have monks. Because the problem with Staff + Unarmed skills has been fixed in MMMerge, monks can now enjoy multiple damage bonuses - Unarmed Combat Master + Staff Grandmaster + Armsmaster Master at the same time. Meanwhile, the bug with Dodge Master's chance to evade attack has also been fixed (in the original game, it is always 10%; now it's fixed by temporarily setting the Armor Class to 10000 when dodging an attack). Therefore, as long as there are enough skill points, a monk could leap into a super unbalanced character that can dodge up to 87%, with 240 single attack damage guaranteed, equipped with a staff "of Darkness", and whose HP is only second to a dragon.

2) The quality of items sold in stores has been greatly reduced. Currently, only the top stores in the three continents sell white potions and level 3 items.

3) The chance that one can loot an items from a monster's corpse is reduced to 10%.

We begin with 5 peasants, they will become Thief, Paladin, Cleric, Sorcerer and Knight respectively in New Sorpigal...

Arrange items, only this +4 Disarm Trap ring is worth keeping

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/005.jpg)

Visit experts to change character's class. Thief: Identify Skill expert on the second floor of the hotel; Paladin: Spirit Magic expert; Knight: Body Building expert; Cleric: Body Magic expert; Sorcerer: Fire Magic expert.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/006.jpg)

<hr>

A big advantage of the integrated version is that there is a magic card in MM6, so the financial crisis in the early stage can be eased slightly.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/007.jpg)

Search the entire city for business skills and recruit

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/008.jpg)

Another big benefit of the integrated version: Once the reward of the city hall is received, it will definitely be displayed in the current map without special search. It ’s a pity that this is a sheep cult, not worth much money

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/009.jpg)

The third benefit of the integrated version: the donation of each temple is a blessing for a while, so on the first day, you can use the one-hour blessing for a hour to level the three boxes in the northeast, make up the donations, and level the broken temple. Rescue the little girl; then make up and level out the big ear monster outpost; then make up and level up the Southeast Mage camp

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/010.jpg)

The best treasure chest

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/011.jpg)

Under the blessed blessing of the temple, although the black potion cannot be matched with the original MM6, it is sufficient to support a short-term raid.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/012.jpg)

<hr>

Rescue Angela

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/013.jpg)

The first day's task was to open all the treasure chests on this island, rescue the little girl, take the candlestick, and get the big ears password. Finally arrived at the training ground before 18:00.

The warlock eats 2 horseshoes and can raise the water system to level 4.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/014.jpg)

Priest upgrade skill points added to Limb Level 3

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/015.jpg)

Water-based shops will have Lingbo micro-steps, buy!

Limb shops will rebirth, buy!

After training the next day, he howled across the river to the north obelisk to get two horseshoes, and gave them to the priest, who used the map to upgrade the limb experts.

Warlock's water expert is waiting for Free Haven ...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/016.jpg)

It is tuesday

Hire a guide + guide (better explorer) and walk west to Tekken Castle

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/017.jpg)

<hr>

Tekken Castle mainline missions:

Receive salary and transfer to Paladin;

The thief learns the dagger, and the next task is to reach the expert as soon as possible. Because the rogue must be transferred to MM7, MM6 can only be sustained by double daggers.

Prophet gets temple information.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/018.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/020.jpg)

It's Wednesday, and when all is done, take a boat to Misty Island.

Why go to Misty Island? Because there are two major limitations in the integrated version:

1. The NPC cannot be refreshed, and the new Soppig cannot recruit the Guardian Master;

2. Even if you can recruit a guard door, you must go to a map before the time and space door can pass.

Therefore, in order to transfer the mage to the speed water master, you must go to Misty Island in advance...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/021.jpg)

The main task of Misty Island is the transfer of Newton and his second uncle.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/022.jpg)

Grind on the island to 6:00 PM, training will be transferred to next Friday

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/023.jpg)

<hr>

Do n’t hurry to go on Friday.

Misty Island offers a reward for a Rat Man in MM8, and the Rat Man brushed into the air...

No pressure shooting, reward

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/024.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/025.jpg)

On Friday, I returned to Tekken Castle by boat. At this point, Rogue Chanem was at level 3 and the dagger could be upgraded to the expert.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/026.jpg)

Head north to Butreg Bay

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/027.jpg)

There is only one thing in Butrague Bay: drinking magic spring water

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/028.jpg)

Head to Free Haven, meet Sir Tempe, and take on the Cavaliers transfer mission!

[](Https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/029.jpg)

<hr>

The capital of your body is enough to buy a door of time and space.

Free Haven has all the advanced elements and self-magic guilds, and you can slowly complete all the spells here.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/030.jpg)

Hired the carpenter and stonemason to repair the temple

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/031.jpg)

Find the old knight nomination and play cards at the westernmost tavern on the map

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/032.jpg)

Win the money to train the warlock's water and air systems to experts, then learn the Limbo microstep

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/033.jpg)

Hire the door master

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/034.jpg)

The guardian master did not use her first, and everyone returned westward to Butreg Bay.

Now with Limbo Microstep, it's time to pray +10 strength and drink the intellectual personality spring.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/035.jpg)

Finally, the guardian TP went to Misty Island, and the first stage of MM6 was completed early:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/036.jpg)

<hr>

After teleporting to Misty Island, continue training a level, at this time the team lv4.

In the blink of an eye, in February, the reward task of the city hall was changed to the MM7 soul

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/037.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/038.jpg)

Guardian TP returns to New Soppig to receive rewards and receive rewards

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/039.jpg)

Coupled with horseshoes, all three Warlocks went to experts. MM6 relied on the Warlock's aura of red flames to paint the thieves' double daggers.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/040.jpg)

New Soppig packs the Spider Queen.

The integrated version, after completing one turn of any two professions, you will receive a letter from the mysterious witch Verdant in the next treasure chest to be opened.

This letter will open the transmission across the world.

Although the letter said that it was going to the Flying Dragon Desert, in fact, drinking the magic spring water of New Soppig can also trigger a conversation.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/041.jpg)

Since we will not go to MM7 until the main task of MM6 is completed, the letter is collected and ignored.

<hr>

In the integrated version, weapon use experts and masters can be found in Free Haven. The expert is this one:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/042.jpg)

Alchemists are secretive, here:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/043.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/044.jpg)

<hr>

Next, he fully impacted the water master and pastor mage.

Stone Castle in White Hat Township, as Free Haven Temple has been restored

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/045.jpg)

Non-stop to Yinwan Town

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/046.jpg)

In Yinwan Town, the main purpose is to open TP, drink spring water, and take on the task of adjusting the post price

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/047.jpg)

When finished, the Guardian teleports back to Free Haven, heading west to Black County

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/048.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/049.jpg)

Black County takes the task of placing statues and visits the post to adjust the price

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/050.jpg)

Trained one level in Black County, the whole team was lv6; collectively headed north and headed to Criggs Castle.

In Criggs, visit the post to adjust the price; then climb up the northern slopes and visit the hermit in the mountains to end the winter

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/051.jpg)

Guardian TP returns to Free Haven and heads south to Ghost Marsh

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/052.jpg)

At this time, there was only lv6. The monster had not been strengthened by HP, but AC had been strengthened for a round.

Bows and arrows hardly hit... The Holy Spirit must be added to guarantee

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/053.jpg)

Ghost Marsh visited the post to adjust the price, got horseshoes, Master Water Level 7 and the master is beckoning to us!

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/054.jpg)

The Guardian Master TP returns to Misty Island, and after the training, he straightens up to the master of the water system!

<hr>

After rising to the sixth level, the post station price adjustment was completed. At this time, March has entered, and the team has accumulated a certain amount of time to complete some small tasks that are not difficult.

Thick Bay Island Silver Bay Outpost, get the enemy list to rescue the girl:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/055.jpg)

Walk to Tekken Castle, visit the Prophets, Holy Knights, and change to the Crusaders, then prepare to complete all tasks except the second turn of the mage.

Shadow teaches refuge to rescue another girl

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/056.jpg)

Snag Cave, the elevator jumps back at this position, you can hit it for nothing:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/057.jpg)

Hidden 5000 Coins of the Sheep's Church:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/058.jpg)

The treasure chest of Dragon Cavalry Cave:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/059.jpg)

<hr>

Currently picking up the strongest one-handed sword. Seeing that the shape is imported from MM7, the attack bonus is +15, which is more than the sum of all the weapons held by everyone...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/060.jpg)

After completing the station mission, there is no shortage of money. Drink two well waters (+5 strength / endurance, death) in White Hat Town and revive the local temple.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/061.jpg)

<hr>

The Light and Dark Store in Black County is upscale, however, Spotlight Magic Ball, Purdue Sage, Doomsday, Souldrinker will not be sold in the store. Doomsday must go to MM7 Hell City / MM8 Regna to buy.

Spend all your money and buy two stores short:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/062.jpg)

<hr>

MM8 is really not difficult. But MM7's Hell City, it was definitely a lie to death...

<hr>

Newly added potion formula:

Essence of Might=Remove Fear+Heroism

Essence of Intellect=Remove Curse+Shield

Essence of Personality=Remove Fear+Haste

Essence of Endurance=Remove Curse+Recharge Item

Essence of Accuracy=Cure Insanity+Stoneskin

Essence of Speed=Cure Insanity+Harden Item

Essence of Luck=Haste+Heroism, Recharge Item+Shield, Harden Item+Stoneskin

(The above is +15 attribute, -5 attribute potion, the original MM6 can be equipped, and now they are all white level)

Potion of Doom=Remove Curse+Remove Fear/Cure Insanity, Remove Fear+Cure Insanity

(Unintelligible, +1 to all attributes, +1 to AC / HP / MP, aging for 5 years, seems to be able to drink multiple times)

Divine Boost=Divine Power+X (Stat) Boost

Divine Protection=Divine Cure+X (Element) Resistance

(Black potion, based on potency, temporarily increasing all attributes and all resistances)

Divine Transcendance=Divine Restoration+Cure Insanity/Remove Fear/Remove Curse

(Black potion, temporarily upgraded by level 20)

Potion of the Gods=Essence of Might+Harden Item, Essence of Intellect+Stoneskin, Essence of Personality+Recharge Item, Essence of Endurance+Haste, Essence of Accuracy+Shield, Essence of Speed+Heroism

(Best black potion, permanent +20 for all attributes, 10 years of aging)

Pure Resistance=X (Element) Resistance+Essence of Luck

(Best black potion series, certain resistance is permanently +40)

Protection from Magic= Remove Curse+Water Breathing

(Anti-potion potion, white)

<hr>

It is now 3.15 and can no longer be trained, otherwise you will miss the priests turn task (3.20).

So began to clean up some relatively simple tasks on the continent ...

Arrest the Rogue Prince:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/063.jpg)

Moon Temple of Liberty Heaven. It is not yet the time to pray on the full moon night, and the clear monster can get all the attributes. Medusa's petrification uses resistance magic to easily resist:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/064.jpg)

Free paradise dragon cavalry fortress with artifact Mordred:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/065.jpg)

<hr>

Sweep Esrik's grave. The Lich in MM6 is much weaker than Entagrid's mainland. There are no steel darts and dragon balls, but it is quite troublesome to disperse:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/066.jpg)

The loot quality of the coffin in the tomb is obviously higher than in other areas

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/067.jpg)

Sweep the Frozen Fort in White Hat. The enemies are too dense here, almost to cheat death:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/068.jpg)

The first weapon to be picked up:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/069.jpg)

<hr>

The shadows of the frozen highlands are not good to teach, but this teleportation array really makes people cry, and it was hard to figure out what it means to jump from the left to the north and back to the north ...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/070.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/071.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/072.jpg)

<hr>

Now that you've reached Tekken Castle, go to the "Mansion" in Cowlergan.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/073.jpg)

The team hasn't slept for 5 days. After 3AM, Santa rides suddenly to death, the priest is crazy ...

Fortunately, there is a resurrection scroll on hand

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/074.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/075.jpg)

<hr>

TP returned to dense Kirishima to find Sir Newton, his second uncle, and transferred to Archmage

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/076.jpg)

It is currently 3.18. One day before the vernal equinox, teleport back to Free Haven to Butreg Bay

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/077.jpg)

With this moment's strength, it is already easy to sweep the Butreg Bay.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/078.jpg)

The Tauren King in the Sun Temple took a lot of effort, guerrilla warfare + card position

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/079.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/080.jpg)

Tanah Lot all the way to level A, rescued the girl

Place the first statue

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/082.jpg)

Burning Jazz Hall

<hr>

<hr>

The Blazing Jazz Hall is really unfriendly to players playing MM6 for the first time...

To put it simply, first go to the south to get all the amber, then go to the northwest to open the door, then go to the northeast to open the door; then go to the east and jump to the lower floor to kill the VARN guard and get the key, and finally go to the north to get the crystal skull

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/083.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/084.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/085.jpg)

Midway to get the first relic: MM8 Elemental Staff, -40AC is too difficult for the mage, sell money.

(If a full-care patch is applied and a vampire mage is available, then this is a real artifact, and the atomization of the vampire can be completely physically immune)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/086.jpg)

Unlike the description, the magic attribute here only adds half the skills, which further strengthens the determination to sell money.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/087.jpg)

Another artifact found: the ring of dark magic, which can be used at the end of the trilogy

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/088.jpg)

<hr>

Sir Stone transfers duties, pastor transfers to senior pastor

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/089.jpg)

It's finally 3.20, pray in Stone Circle, Druid turns

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/090.jpg)

<hr>

The next step is the Master Priest in the integrated version of MM6.

In the original MM6, the priest and priest can only learn the two masters of light and darkness after the second turn. Only by converting to the occupation corresponding to MM7 / MM8 can the grandmaster light / darkness be learned. The steps for changing jobs in MM6 are as follows:

1) Find the corresponding transfer instructor (with Path of Light / Dark dialog option). I chose two neighbouring neighbors northeast of the village of Blackshire, one light and one dark.

2) Select the avatar of the person you want to transfer, select Path of Light, and enter yes.

3) The transfer will clear the opposite magic factions (such as the priest of light will forget all the dark magic-in fact, the dark magic is directly converted into the same level of magic magic skills).

As shown in the figure, the senior priest transferred to the bright priest:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/091.jpg)

Archmage transferred to Necromancer (Human version of the Lich, there is a dark master, can not learn regeneration, you can further transfer the Lich in MM7 / 8):

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/092.jpg)

Current team status:

A parliamentary task that has been missed: Sir Kilburn's shield, recaptured from Black County Werewolf

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/094.jpg)

It ’s 3.20 in the afternoon. I ’m back after a long absence from the training ground! Collectively rose to lv9.

Necromancer reaches Level 7 Qi Master, and then works hard to reach Level 10 Water Master. Rev. Bright rushes to the soul master. Chanem began to gain some insight, otherwise he could not clear the customs ...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/095.jpg)

TP went to the Yindu Fortress and the Independence Monument in Yinwan to sweep away.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/096.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/097.jpg)

In the two boxes of the Independence Monument, I got the ring of MM8 fusion, the second sacred object.

Selling money...

There is another thing that is not better than the Holy Relic: Dragon Breath Book

Consolidated version of the druid two turns, any day at midnight

The integrated version has stealth in the MM6. Now that the Master Qi is a master, he goes to the Dragon Desert:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/101.jpg)

First visit the Pillar of the Gods with +20 full attributes in the Flying Dragon Desert

Leaving the mage, everyone else drinks the +10 stat and +10 resistance (destroy) spring water twice. The mage flew to a safe area and returned to Free Haven for treatment.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/103.jpg)

As for the mage body, since the door protector and the wind chaser can be directly hired in the small village in the southwest, after the invisibility is made up, these two will be replaced by the TP.

Below is the status of the team after visiting the Flying Dragon Desert. Not playing buffs is already very powerful!

I don't know why, both springs seem to have +20 attributes and resistance, it seems to be a powerful beneficial bug.

Because of this benign bug, make yourself a little harder from now on:

1) In each world (MM6 / 7/8), you can only see the god of death at most once, Breach is not limited;

2) Every time you cross the world, everyone can only leave * one piece of equipment, and throw away * all * money, and fire * all * NPC

3) The difficulty rises to 125% -150% -175%!

When the statue was installed in the Flying Dragon Desert, I finally saw the traverser, the female mage Verdant.

Verdant explained to us that the letter was sent by her, hoping to find qualified candidates in every world.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/110.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/111.jpg)

... but there was a problem with her spell, causing only three teams left in the three worlds (that is, this team of Chanem). They had to travel through the entire world of the trilogy.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/112.jpg)

Verdant tells us: The ultimate mission is to build a Telelocator for her

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/113.jpg)

Verdant tells us: To build a teleporter, you need to go to the gray dwarf gathering area of ​​Alva in the MM8 world to grab certain types of ore. Of course, this is the last word.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/114.jpg)

We ask: what to do on the mainland of Enlos? Verdant just said that completing the process normally

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/115.jpg)

TP returned to New Soppig, and the walker jumped out without taking two steps... This is definitely a bug!

The traverser gave us a stone of the portal. If you don't know what to do, put it away first.

Four crystals: Alamos Castle.

Alamos Castle is full of malice, designing a huge number of useless passages and misleading routes. Fortunately, the enemy here is already a bunch of roosters.

Clear all four directions of the hall (NE, SE, NW, SW)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/177.jpg)

One of the best treasure armors of MM6, it can reduce the damage and recover

At the same time got the relic Hades sword.

The true attributes of Hardis in the integrated version are:

1. A 100 acid bullet is hit with each swing.

2. +10 Disassembly.

3. +20 luck.

Life automatically reduces this attribute, without feeling it at all. It can be considered the strongest (non-dark, non-weapon use) one-handed sword in the whole game ...

But because we are going to throw the equipment, we can just refresh one or two maps.

Three of the four largest castles: Black Moore.

Preliminary preparation: Since the enemy can disperse at any time, it is necessary to make up some buffs that cannot be dispelled, including:

1. Blood sucking on the weapon;

2. Go to Sweet Water Town to drink +50 attributes and +20 full resistance;

3. Go to Criggs and drink + 40AC;

4. Hire a weapon master and a magic master. A + 15% experience teacher was also hired in actual combat;

5. All melee members go to Yinwan to drink crazy spring water.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/181.jpg)

Open the first agency. This is not really necessary, because the first gates at both ends of the divided castle can jump through.

Before attacking the second hall, tirelessly beat out the magic eyes one by one.

Plenty of healing potions

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/185.jpg)

When attacking the third hall, you can stand at the door and accelerate to knock down most of the magic eyes and litchis with bows and arrows. Explosive bows work better.

The true relic plus the black potion of air resistance.

Therefore, in the integrated version, the Druid actually has a battlefield, the master alchemy + master self + master element, while HP growth is 4. In contrast, the priest and mage can only grow up to 3 in the integrated version.

At last! Focus!

One thing inside Heymore Castle is that there is a back door to the crystal in the second area.

This back door is not very important in itself, but there are four "doomsday trials" on the floor! !!

In the integrated version, the only place where the Doomsday Judgment can be bought is MM7's Hell City and MM8's Regna. So if you start with Enlos, this is the only way to learn the doomsday trial. Remember not to forget!

Thick Titan Island and the Titans in Paradise Valley, death is really difficult to deal with (the master's limbs are not learned in MM6, there is no way to resist). The Titan King is as high as 1000 + HP, it is unrealistic to die by doom, give up ...

Attack the last castle directly: The Ultimate Ramming Temple

<hr>

The ultimate Yangming Temple was lacking, the only thing that was not careful was to jump off the high platform, resulting in three tombstones for five players. Fortunately, there are several resurrection scrolls in hand

If you don't count "Witchcraft 4," Vilan's grave should be the most complicated labyrinth and the largest map in the RPG that has been played. The main points are:

First, clear all enemies in the entrance hall, pyramid hall, radiation hall, and back door;

Secondly, go from the back of the map to the right underground passage, and after passing the complicated underground passage, rush to the 10th position of the Raiders map and get the key of the water temple:

The title Super Goober actually means "super big fool". It belongs to the bad taste of the production team. It mocks the control blocks that players get in the grave of Vilan. It has nothing to do with whether the game is complete...

However, if the control block is common in MM6 / MM7, then you can actually use the MM7 radish head / Talberti control block to fill it... Then take the product and recharge it. Seems to be able to skip the Viran grave

It felt like I had seen the reactor less than 1/3 of the exploration... A random shot swept to death.

The 5btu's grenade gun is really a butchery!

The demon queen fired three rounds of fire and fell under the firepower of the 5btu grenade gun.

A ring was given: the ring of life, which can release shared life magic, plus 20 Constitution. Specific needs to be studied...

Crossing to elacia

The difficulty is adjusted to 150%. Nightmare difficulty begins!

As soon as it landed, the messenger told us: The Emerald Island Contest is online. Every Wednesday, you can take a boat to Emerald Island directly from Eracia.

Switch the small tip of the place: S / L in place, or switch the map and come back, or exit the game and re-enter, then drink magic spring water.

Move the mouse to the arch of the portal. According to the picture, you can directly see where the teleportation is. The picture below is the entrance picture of Catherine Castle:

Turn around and turn your face, take the vase

Walk to Bairds to visit the Dwarven King and continue the mine rescue mission

It ’s exactly Sunday, visit the arena once, prepare for the second turn of the MM7 Knights mission

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/269.jpg)

The arena is still a bit strong. For example, this 901HP blue-clad mage... A bolt of lightning can split the unprotected priest in half HP

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/270.jpg)

Once the MM7 warlock turns, the golden man enlists normally

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/271.jpg)

<hr>

The rescue of the dwarves was unbelievable, and the clay monsters were not strengthened at all.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/272.jpg)

Sweep the dwarven treasure house. Seems to have found something extraordinary, this is not a big gem in the wolf's cave...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/273.jpg)

After completing the task of clearing the cavemen, the reputation in Stone Town went up to -60.

TP back to Hammondale, Elacia and Eli start Cold War

pay attention! Just found out:

After getting the ring of ghosts in the haunted house, it will give the equipment person a permanent "Blessing of Heavenly Blessing", which is really tailored for the priest

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/284.jpg)

<hr>

Come to Eli. After turning around, Chanem can finally upgrade the weapon master, and the double-dagger thief is officially formed.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/285.jpg)

Priest upgrades limb master in Eli

Elven Ring, + Half Air Skill

The next time was to wander through the uncleaned dungeon...

Sweep the mercenary guild and get the captain's blade

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/288.jpg)

Come to Nigan.

Note: The transfer of Warlock does not mention the Dark Road.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/289.jpg)

In Diya, upgrade the Hammer Stick Grandmaster.

The hero is now settled... Only a dark hammer is missing

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/290.jpg)

Don't forget to visit the altars of Diya, Evermont, Nigan

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/291.jpg)

Sweep the magic school of Brakada.

The difficulty here can be assessed as one of the most tedious dungeons before choosing a route. Gain a Crane Amulet, +15 Alchemy

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/292.jpg)

<hr>

I just upgraded the Master ’s Alchemy to the Master and tried to mix the Destruction Potion. This potion is still very useful... +1 all attributes, +1 all resistance.

Each person drank 5 bottles, otherwise the attribute decay will occur if they are over 50 years old

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/293.jpg)

Get a light and dark cloak on Evermont.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/294.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/295.jpg)

The Light and Dark Cloak is considered a normal + half-skilled item in the game, so it cannot stack with other normal + skills

<hr>

Sweep the cellars of Tetalia. How to deal with the wizard king? Resurrection spell! The resurrected Blue Vampire can resist a Dragon King's Dragon Ball + Steel Dart (full blood to red blood), and will automatically seek the enemy, it is really the best helper

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/296.jpg)

Necromancer was suffocated by himself, killed by us and resurrected

Sweep Crank Labs and jump from the well to open hidden artifact chests

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/300.jpg)

In other words, it's the first time I've seen a treasure since I came to the Entagari mainland. Or Enros's imported...

<hr>

In September, the fruit trees on both sides of Hammonddale Avenue have begun to fall

<hr>

Sweep Nigan Tunnel and get Zocal's skull

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/310.jpg)

After reflection on the No. 6 watchtower, the Wheel of Life ring reduced the need for healing during normal combat, but it almost eliminated the role of the warrior blood cow, and could not assume the task of resisting most of the damage and taking his teammates to replenish the blood... Throw away this cheating thing...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/311.jpg)

Sweep the Over tunnel. Beamon and Medusa did not strengthen at all, the level was only lv24.

Came to the Giant's Territory and met an acquaintance. How did the pistol come by fast delivery ...

New style of straw shoes, attributes are too attractive

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/316.jpg)

<hr>

The integrated version of the magic lamp skill has become completely random.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/317.jpg)

Only Titan Castle is left before choosing the route

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/318.jpg)

Give the horn to the arbitrator

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/319.jpg)

Then TP went back to the castle and went out, the arbitrator was extremely sad and heart attack.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/320.jpg)

Choose a light route

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/321.jpg)

Ghosts are great

The lobby is basically cleaned up

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/336.jpg)

Attacking the second channel, bridgehead assault, six red ghost battles, dragons throwing beads and steel darts flying together

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/337.jpg)

It's very beautiful, but we can't learn in MM7. No dark master is willing to teach us ...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/338.jpg)

<hr>

Dusk castle itself is relatively easy to fight, there are many dead corners to use, and you can also resurrect a large number of red ghosts.

Pedestrians advise us to play the role of a good caravan guard

This prophet suggests that most people have not seen it. In the original MM8, this comment can only be seen by visiting the Prophet directly before yelling across the river without contacting the caravan leader.

Thanks to @ 武 骧 金星, the 10.08 HP issue is too high, you can fix it in the following ways:

Open Data / Tables / Bolster-formulas.txt and change the two HP formulas, ^ (power function symbol), to * (multiplier)

After correction, the correct HP display is shown in the figure:

Calling the traversers through teleportation stones. After handing in the enchanted staff, Verdant asked us to find the wayfinding gem in MM7's Stone Town

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/395.jpg)

The wayfinding gems have long been thrown out of my mind...

So you can only call up the console and change out this and the next quest item. Item codes are 664 and 665

![](https://github.com/might-and- magic / mm678-guide / raw / master / img / walkthrough / 397.jpg)

You can release TP in this small lake in the Dagger Injury Islands, and recharge the teleport stone to call out the traversers at any time.

Handing over the guide gems, Verdant asked us to go to the MM6 Cowergan Mansion to find a rag parcel

Use the changed cross

In order to build the portal staff, Verdant gave us two more collection tasks.

The first task: find each of the following types of gems;

The second task: search the four element planes to collect samples (enter and exit to see the prompt)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/401.jpg)

Visit several elemental realms while collecting gems, just enter and exit

Attack the Yadak Lair, get an explosive bow, and equip it

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/405.jpg)

I also got a light knife, but it is actually eggless in MM8, because the blade of the first kingdom + vampire sword is the best combination

It took a year to travel to three continents, and finally in December, I collected a 7w bounty to upgrade the Bounty Master Guild mission

Verdant's next mission is "Attribute Challenge". The seven attributes that require the current interlocutor (Chaenem) are relatively high. If you are not confident, you can visit NWC's +256 post first

Verdant's next mission needs to collect ten "Philosopher Stones", top catalysts...

Trying to get ten, hand in the task

Verdant's next task is to collect all kinds of red herbs:

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/432.jpg)

This task is really funny... There are countless people on the forum who chanted the Phoenix feathers. Correct the crossover:

<hr>

After submitting this mission, Verdant disappeared. We continue to complete the main task

Attack on Regna

On the way from regna island to TP back to crow shore, you can see the scene of pirate siege, bank deposits will also be taken away

Back at Crow's Shore, first visit the old acquaintances at the guest house: Queen Catherine and King Roland

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/441.jpg)

Catherine stated that all the Creegans on Entagari's continent had been eradicated (continuing the Doomblade Battle). It has been 1165-1172 for 9 years since Norfolk was assassinated by Chanem, Lucifer has challenged Elassia to be beaten.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/442.jpg)

Roland is a lot older, and Sir Humphrey isn't old.

Attack the Escardon Palace. Artifacts everywhere, basically all artifacts were taken at least once.

Escarton said: He is a robot created by ancient people, responsible for cleaning up the world contaminated by the Krigans. Starting from the quiet age (Cregan cut off communication channels between Colony and the ancients), this continent will sooner or later be invaded by the Kregans.

Chanem said: The Krigan people on this continent have been ambush, and the ancient communication channels have been restored by Corak.

One-handed Sword Wallace. Unfortunately it's too late...

The main task of Jadami mainland completed

Verdant congratulates us on the completion of MM8

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/450.jpg)

<hr>

The next task seems to be unable to continue because of a bug. Verdant does not prompt us how to teleport to Breach anyway...

Change it and jump to Breach

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/451.jpg)

The final task could not be completed, so this hastily ended the integrated version of the Travels.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/452.jpg)

If any expert knows how to finally trigger the Verdant prompt to send a conversation to Breach, please also inform and appreciate it...

<hr>

After unremitting efforts, especially thanks to the great help of @ 1qwop0 大哥, finally completed the integrated version correctly!

In short, after the three continents have been completely calmed down, you need to wait a week. The easiest way is to train a level, and then rest for an hour, Verdant will contact the heroes to start the ultimate task: imprison "escaping chaos" .

As shown in the figure, you can use the console to observe the actual time

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/453.jpg)

Before entering the cracks of time and space, first hit all buffs. There will be no buff for quite some time...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/454.jpg)

Walking into the crystal ruins, the mage moved the gate of time and space!

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/455.jpg)

Teleported to The Breach-a crack in time and space.

The whole team was separated, leaving only Charnheim.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/456.jpg)

Fortunately, his NPC is still there, and the Black Dragon joins the team

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/457.jpg)

The map of the entire space-time crack is Alva using MM8, but only the northern part of Alva is retained. In the middle of the map is a huge castle in time and space. Southwest of the map is the mage tower; southeast of the map is Tekken Castle.

We headed northeast all the way to the northeast village of Alba.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/458.jpg)

There are several things to be done in the cracks of time and space:

1. Find all teammates.

2. Solve the mystery of the chaotic incarnation in the village of Alwa.

3. Capture the escaped chaos.

4. Enter the castle spire in the crack of time and space to end the chaos.

Your four teammates are at:

a. Ogre Fortress

b. Alwa Chamber of Commerce Headquarters

c. Tekken Castle Headquarters

d. On the Southwest Tower (walking as a monster)

Our little dragon was soon beheaded by monsters all over the land

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/459.jpg)

Anyway, go to the left on the northwest of the map and find the first teammate to disperse: Mage Alex

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/460.jpg)

<hr>

Although there is a mage, in the cracks of time and space, as long as the flight is performed, a cactus will be brushed around every minute. It is better to be careful with the 200% difficulty bonus...

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/461.jpg)

Go to the headquarters of Tekken Castle in the southeast of the map to find the great hero Roderick.

As long as you take him here, all the swordsmen will be immediately hostile, be sure to guard the intersection and run away slowly

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/462.jpg)

... Or fly under the attack of a cactus

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/463.jpg)

Came to the former Chamber of Commerce headquarters of the village of Alva in the north of the map, and the hero Zordan joined.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/464.jpg)

The last and hardest teammate was in the Southwest Tower, searching carefully on the platform above

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/465.jpg)

Our great bright priest Serena! This monster almost didn't recognize it

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/466.jpg)

Serina tells us that we need to solve at least five puzzles to leave the cracks of time and space

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/467.jpg)

<hr>

Back to the Alpha Village in the north. Visit each dwelling, drugstore, and shop carefully, click the door with your mouse, and answer the puzzles of each incarnation one by one.

Just click on Riddle, don't click on others, otherwise the chaos incarnation will be embarrassed and anger to drive you out of the door

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/468.jpg)

Become a child

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/469.jpg)

Puzzle answer

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/470.jpg)

In the end, after solving at least five puzzles, the chaos incarnation expressed that it would not fight or know each other, and was willing to resolve the dispute peacefully (join the team and become an NPC)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/471.jpg)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/472.jpg)

At the end, entering from the entrance of the original dark dwarf settlement is the endless dungeon of time and space cracks. All the way to the castle of time and space, from the castle's teleporter to the spire, click on the red light ball!

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/473.jpg)

Customs clearance certificate (this file can't be printed, take the previous number)

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/474.jpg)

Time and space cracks dissipated and peace was restored!

Can continue to teleport from the blue light ball to any world.

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/475.jpg)

At last...

<hr>

Insert the telelocator into the table on the last high platform

Click on the blue light sphere to end the crack in time and space

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/477.jpg)

...

Re-entering the samsara, we are back at the door of the new Sopig with letters in our hands

![](https://github.com/might-and-magic/mm678-guide/raw/master/img/walkthrough/478.jpg)

A new hero adventure is about to begin ...

The end
